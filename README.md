# Dynamic-Maze-Solver
Java-based GUI application that solves mazes using backtracking algorithm. It visualizes the maze-solving process in real-time, highlighting the current path, backtracking steps, and teleportation through portals. The application effectively demonstrates pathfinding algorithms by marking visited cells, backtracking paths, and portal usage.
